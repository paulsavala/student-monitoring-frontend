This course presents a threefold approach to calculus: numerical, graphical, and analytical techniques are all emphasized. The fourth credit hour is devoted to active-learning and inquiry based activities to reinforce course material. Prerequisite: MATH 2312 with a grade of C or better. Fall, Spring.", active=True)
calc2 = Course(title="CALCULUS II", subject="MATH", number="2414", description="A continuation of MATH 2413. Topics include applications of the integral, additional techniques of anti-differentiation, improper integrals, introduction to differential equations, Taylor polynomials and Taylor series, and the Mean Value Theorem. Prerequisites: MATH 2413 with a grade of C or better. Fall, Spring", active=True)
calc3 = Course(title="ADVANCED CALCULUS", subject="MATH", number="3316", description="A rigorous treatment of the real-number system; of real sequences; and of limits, continuity and derivatives of functions of one real variable. Prerequisite: MATH 2414 and MATH 3318 with a grade of C or better or consent of instructor. Fall.", active=True)
lin_alg = Course(title="LINEAR ALGEBRA", subject="MATH", number="3305", description="Systems of equations, determinants, algebra and geometry of finite-dimensional linear vector spaces, linear transformations, the algebra of matrices, and the theory of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Prerequisite: MATH 2413. Spring.", active=True)
